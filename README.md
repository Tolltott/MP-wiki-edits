## Exploring patterns in edits to MP Wikipedia pages

The main data set for this study consisted of 38,983 instances of edits to the Wikipedia pages of current MPs who were elected or re-elected at the 2017 general election. Attributes of the data include the IP address of user, the name of the page (name of the MP), delta of the edit (net change in characters from the edit) and a comment explaining the edit. The data was extracted from the publicly available Wikipedia API. The IP address of each edit was matched to a postcode and constituency of its location using an online tool. 

Additional data was also sourced covering 
The party represented by MP from [TheyWorkforYou](http://www.theyworkforyou.com)  
Constituency boundaries from [ONS Open Geography Portal](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/)  
2017 General Election information from [The Electoral Commission](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/our-work/our-research/electoral-data/electoral-data-files-and-reports).
